              Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold">Russel James Recamunda</span>, 
              a graduate in Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and an aspiring 
              Full Stack Developer with a passion for building practical and impactful digital solutions. 
              With hands-on experience from academic and personal projects, I specialize in creating responsive 
              front-end interfaces, integrating robust back-end functionalities, and managing databases to deliver 
              seamless web applications. I enjoy working at the intersection of creativity and technology, 
              continuously learning new tools and frameworks to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape. 
              One of my goals is to contribute to real-world development projects, especially for businesses that 
              not only meet operational needs but also provide meaningful value to users. I am eager to contribute 
              professionally, grow through new challenges, and continue expanding my skills by adapting to the 
              fast-changing world of technology.
